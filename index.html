  <h3>
Orbital Vector</h3>

<p>An arcade style space sim shooter that models orbital trajectories around super dense asteroids or artificial gravity generators to control vital resources or strategically important regions. Player will be able to control a maneuverable fighter craft with a diverse set of weaponry and finite fuel or deltaV. They must capture orbital nodes or land on the mother well to reprogram its logic matrix. There well be weapon and fuel depots at various orbits, combat support from your side, that you can make use of to extend your combat duration. But be careful, as docking will make you very vulnerable to enemy fire and could be fuel-consumming.  </p>

		    In Orbital Vector, there is a data structure that manages the current state of the objects in motion, as well as the future states of those objects. When objects collide or go out of scope, they need to be deleted without breaking future states.

		    You are in a circular orbit 1km above the asteroid in a 3km orbit radius going at roughly 300m/s. You complete one revolution every 62.8 seconds. A bogie appears directly above you, exactly between you and the sun. He's 10km up and he's coming in fast. He's signature is fuzzy and you can't get a lock on him. Your only choice is run, but how? Speeding up would boost your apoapsis (highest point in your orbit) and slow you down, making you a perfect target. So you slow down...

		    Orbiting in space is not merely floating on inertia in empty space. Orbiting is more or less falling and missing the ground. You are constantly bound to one or more gravity wells. This simple mechanic changes the battle field completely in very counter-intuitive ways.

<a name="orbital-domination-working-title" class="anchor" href="#orbital-domination-working-title"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Orbital Domination (working title)</h3>

<p>A civilization-level strategy game where each nation/state must compete over limited resources and trade in a highly interconnected solar economy. Some nations intend on dominating its neighbors with military might while others focus on economic control. An ally may backstab you if coerced by another nation in the form of bribes or economic sanctions. There are public pledges of support and backdoor channels. Changing tide in economy could change trade negotiations on hydrogen tariffs from the time Jupiter harvesting begins and when the first shipment of deuterium pods reenter earth's atmosphere. A nation may sell food to its enemy in order to fund a defensive solar array weapon. Import tariffs could start a war. Piracy on interplanetary routes may be a pretext for an planetary invasion.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="assets/olympus.jpg"></div>  

<p>There are a lot of things that could be done with a solar system setting turn based strategy game. I think this just scratches the surface. Imagine you must maintain relationship with an enemy nation until your much-needed deuterium shipment leaves the borders of its vast reaches in to space.</p>

<h3>About this blog</h3>
<p>This blog documents the development steps of the Orbital game series as well as the overall goal and philosophy at Orbital Velocity. The games will be open sourced under the MIT license by the end of 2014, along with a set of tutorials/guides to spur community involvement and facilitate more people entering game development. I am currently learning OpenGL as I go and I hope to share what I learned and get feed back on the games as they mature. Feel free to fork and create your own realistic (or not) space games! 
</p>
<p>Orbital Velocity is the dev blog for the projects Orbital Vector, an arcade space-sim in an orbital environment, and Orbital Domination, a high-level strategy game where cities are in constant free-fall.
