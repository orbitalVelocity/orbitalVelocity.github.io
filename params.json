{"name":"Blogging at Orbital Velocity","tagline":"A small step towards our future in orbital space!","body":"### Welcome to Orbital Velocity\r\n\r\nThis blog documents the development steps of the Orbital game series as well as the overall goal and philosophy at Orbital Velocity. The games will be open sourced under GPL V2 by the end of 2014, along with a set of tutorials/guides to spur community involvement and facilitate more people entering game development. I am currently learning OpenGL as I go and I hope to share what I learned and get feed back on the games as they mature. Feel free to fork and create your own realistic (or not) space games! \r\n\r\n### To Interplanetary Space!\r\nOrbiting in space is not merely floating on inertia in empty space. Orbiting is more or less falling and missing the ground. You are constantly bound to one or more gravity wells. This simple mechanic changes the battle field completely in very counter-intuitive ways.\r\n\r\n- **The higher you are, the slower you move** But the faster you go, the higher you get. If you want to catch-up with some one ahead of you, you must slow down first. \r\n- **Fuel is a scarce resource** You can trade fuel for speed, or time for fuel. You can speed up to catch up with someone, but you may run out of fuel and drift into the ether. The less fuel you have, the faster you can accelerate.\r\n- **There is no fog of war** You can see a shuttle fire its maneuver jets out from Pluto. There is no sneaking up behind someone. Not from nebular clouds, asteroid belts, or planetary rings. Engagements are determined not by sensor range, but weapon range.\r\n- **It's very boring** Traveling to the moon takes a day or two, to Mars takes months, and years to farther planets. Any ship-to-ship engagements would be known weeks or months ahead of time, giving both sides plenty of time to calculate their next moves.\r\n\r\nWhile these limitations could be pretty boring to a normal space sim, I think they can be very fertile to the imagination. Rules of engagement would be vastly different. How would nations and sovereignties hash out their disputes given these vast distances? How could space combat be fun given such large time-scales?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Orbital Vector\r\nIf the only thing keeping a realistic space combat sim from being fun in space is the time then it can be either sped up or shortened. Speeding up means much less time to react and ships will pass by way too fast to ever see. Shrinking the world means shorter orbital periods and decreasing distances to other crafts. \r\n\r\nOrbital Vector is an arcade style space sim that models orbital trajectories around super dense asteroids or artificial gravity generators to control vital resources or strategically important regions. Player will be able to control a maneuverable fighter craft with a diverse set of weaponry and finite fuel or deltaV. They must capture orbital nodes or land on the mother well to reprogram its logic matrix. There well be weapon and fuel depots at various orbits, combat support from your side, that you can make use of to extend your combat duration. But be careful, as docking will make you very vulnerable to enemy fire and could be fuel-consumming.  \r\n\r\nGame play\r\n- Third person view of ship, with zoom levels from ship to planet scale\r\n- Trajectory predictions for targeting\r\n- Proximity to incoming trajectories\r\n- Computing firing solutions via GPS satellites\r\n- Anti-missile drones for impact deflection\r\n- EVA repair activity during down time\r\n\r\nGraphical feature wish-list\r\n- HDR/bloom/flair\r\n- Anti-aliasing\r\n- Filmic grain\r\n- Film quality motion blur\r\n- Bokeh?\r\n- Deferred rendering\r\n- Soft shadows\r\n- BRDF rendering\r\n- Dynamic tessellation\r\n- High quality 3D lines\r\n- Particles/sfx\r\n\r\nPhysics / Misc wish-list\r\n- Physic driven animation - missiles, ship maneuvers\r\n- Stabilizer via gyroscopic motion dampeners\r\n- Continuous collision detection\r\n- AI that can predict trajectories and evade incoming warheads\r\n- Goal oriented AI for control-point maps\r\n- Multi-gravity well maps\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Orbital Domination (working title)\r\nA civilization-level strategy game where each nation/state must compete over limited resources and trade in a highly interconnected solar economy. Some nations intend on dominating its neighbors with military might while others focus on economic control. An ally may backstab you if coerced by another nation in the form of bribes or economic sanctions. There are public pledges of support and backdoor channels. Changing tide in economy could change trade negotiations on hydrogen tariffs from the time Jupiter harvesting begins and when the first shipment of deuterium pods reenter earth's atmosphere. A nation may sell food to its enemy in order to fund a defensive solar array weapon. Import tariffs could start a war. Piracy on interplanetary routes may be a pretext for an planetary invasion.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that could be done with a solar system setting turn based strategy game. I think this just scratches the surface. Imagine you must maintain relationship with an enemy nation until your much-needed deuterium shipment leaves the borders of its vast reaches in to space.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nA grad student who should be working on his thesis, but loves loves loves space and gaming and hard science fiction.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
