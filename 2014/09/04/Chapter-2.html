  <h3>Out of the pan, into the fire</h3>

<p class="meta">Sol 7 - Mars</p>

<p>I woke up to the roaring sound of the HVAC. It was rather soothing. At least it drowned out the empty loneliness of being the last man on the planet. The closes people were a hundred miles up, and after them, hundreds of <em>millions</em> of miles out. But that was the least of my concerns.</p>

<p>Thanks to the cruel hand of fate, the meteor shower missed both the hab and myself. I was fully intended to live out my last hours out there in the brown ochre desert, slowly caked by fine razor sharp dust over the eons. But, to my surprise, when I turned and saw the hab still standing with not a scratch on it, I figured, <em>what the hell.</em> </p>

<p>So I swallowed the pain and lugged the antenna, still embedded in my side, back to the airlock. I wish it was as easy as that sounds, but I am not about to recall that part in any detail. Just the thought gives me hot flashes. Once I was back in and could get a hold of some morphine, I pulled the damn thing out and patched myself as best I could. It does not look pretty. It is pretty horrifying, in fact. But what do you expect? I am an electronics technician, not a doctor. </p>

<p>With that out of the way, I got on the comm in search of a signal. Nope. All static. I did not expect to find a signal, of course. The comm array was in pieces. One piece was inside of me and I think a bit of that is still in there somewhere. </p>

<p>And what would I have done if I could talk to my fellow crew members up orbiting overhead? Come back down and pick me up? The MAV only had enough fuel for one ascent. It does not even have a heat shield or parachutes for a reentry. They are stuck up there while I am stuck down here.</p>

<p>That is not true, though. They should be rendezvousing with <em>Hermes</em> now. <em>Hermes</em> is the interplanetary vehicle with the delta-V to get back to earth. And now that they are back up, they have no reason not to go back. They would die if the stayed. </p>

<p><em>Just as I would.</em></p>

<p>But that does not stop me from living as long as I could. I checked the inventory of supplies and food stuffs. There was enough to feed six adults for two months, which should keep me going for a year. If I ration it out, it can last longer. There are enough medical supplies for a quite a few lacerations and traumatic injuries. 1500 hours of C02 filters for EVA. The oxygenator will work long enough for me to starve to death.</p>

<p>And starve to death is my most likely scenario. The next <em>Ares</em> mission is not due for four years. Assuming they get their act together and launch at the next launch window for a rescue mission, which is every 26 months and itâ€™s been 8 months since the last one, that would put it at 18 months plus another eight for them to get here. So I just took 26, subtracted eight, and added back the eight. I need more sleep.</p>

<p>If I can eat half the food, I could starve to death just a month before they get here. <em>Lovely.</em></p>

<p>All of this predicates on two conditions: that 1.) they know I am alive and 2.) they know I can survive to the next rescue mission. I can solve the first by writing SOS in the sand. But it does me no good if I fail the other condition.</p>

<p>I have to survive first.</p>
