<h3>This was not how I would have pictured my death</h3>

<p class="meta">Sol 6 - Mars</p>

<p><em>At least I have no regrets.</em></p>

<p>Pinned down by the UHF antenna like a doll to a dartboard, I regained consciousness only to catch sight of hell on Mars. Endless streaks of fire raking across the sky. <em>The sky is falling again,</em> I figured. Up in the air, a candle of white light held still against the crimson torrent. The Martian Ascent Vehicle was well on escape path to orbit. </p>

<p>Then the memories flooded back to me like memcpy over DMA. </p>

<p>Houston had radioed in an hour ago about an impending meteor shower on our coordinate. The convoy of space rocks was spotted by some amateur astronomy group two days ago. They calculated the trajectory and found out the point of intersection on Mars, so they forwarded it to NASA. When nothing happened, because bureaucracy–they tweeted it. That caused a media outburst and prompted Fred Johnson, the director of NASA, to issue a notice to Alex Troika, the flight director, who in turn told Marshal Ericsson, flight comm, to give us, the sitting ducks, the heads up.</p>

<p>Six astronauts, having spent the past eight months in an inflatable bag to get to the most exotic place mankind can go, must now scramble back up the pipe or be pulverized. </p>

<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>

<p>Of course no one said that. No one wants to be the <em>that guy</em> that broke down and panicked and jeopardized  the survival of the team and would then have to spend another eight months facing alternating treatments of distrust and pity. No. No one was going to freakout, not visibly anyway. But we all shared the thought for a moment. I could see it in Shepard’s face. In Timmy’s face. Jenna’s. Naomi. Jin. Everyone froze for a half second before we switched gears, dumped what we were holding or carrying at the time and started the emergency escape procedure.</p>

<p>Astronauts are a chill crowd. We are selected to be the most confident and alert people, with thousands of hours of training under our belts, to act professional, calm and collected under duress. But something happened after we were told we had forty minutes to pack up and go home or else be pounded into smithereens. That was when we scrambled for the MAV, our ticket home. Now, by scramble I mean we took turns shoving each other into our suits, cutting the procedure down from a calm and collected fifty minutes to a frantic twenty. We depressurized the hab and filed out of the airlock three at a time–not like we had a choice–and bounced over to the MAV like Raving Rabbids. As the first of us climbed into the escape vehicle, the first set of rocks started showering over our helmets. I was in the second group out of the airlock, which means I had twenty minutes of extra pre-breathing than the first group. Thirty-eight minutes since the radio dispatch, I climbed out of the airlock and followed Timmy and Jenna up the ladder. For safety sake, only one person climbs the ladder at a time, even under circumstances like this. No one wants to be a part of the dominoes when the guy above you slips and falls. Which, unfortunately, was what happened to me when a rock struck the communication array and sent a shrapnel right into my suit. </p>

<p>I fell like a sack of potatoes in the Martian gravity.</p>

<p>Then this hell-scape greeted my bloodshot eyes. I was still dizzy from the fall when I realized an alarm was making a racket. The suit pressure meter was showing a steady decline, 3 PSI and falling. </p>

<p>Spacesuits are basically human shaped balloons. The higher the pressure the more rigid it gets and harder to move inside it. Consequently, suits are pressurized to 4.7 PSI, much lower than the 16 PSI at sea level. They get away with this by using pure oxygen. It is a common misconception that this would lead to oxygen toxicity, but that only occurs at hyperbaric pressures.  The suit is pressured to roughly 80% partial pressure of oxygen on earth at sea level, which is about the oxygen content in Denver Colorado.</p>

<p>Luckily my arms still worked so they pulled the breach kit out of its holding and sprayed it over the puncture.</p>

<p><em>Save the pounding pain in my side, this is not a bad way to go.</em>  It was not as if I had any other option. Dust clouds were exploding all around me as the meteors pulverized the landscape. The supply pods launched in preparation for our arrival were being shredded in spectacular Michael Bay fashion. As the character Rockhound said in my favorite movie, <em>Armageddon</em>, “I have a front row seat to the end of the world.”</p>

<p>End of my world anyway.</p>
